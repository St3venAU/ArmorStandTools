A full suite of Armor Stand tools for CraftBukkit/Spigot

Spigot resource page with plugin download: http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/armor-stand-tools.2237/

Inspiration
-----------
I wanted to create an armor stand for each kit in my mini-game, and I quickly became frustrated with trying to use commands and numeric values to position the legs, arms, body and head of each armor stand, so I created this plugin which allows you to do all of this with ease. Simply couch/sneak while right clicking an armor stand to open the tools. The plugin can also generate a summon command that will re-create the armor stand at any time.

-------------
- Armor Stand Tools v4.x.x - Spigot/CraftBukkit 1.17+

- WorldGuard region support, including a custom WorldGuard flag. Set the 'ast' flag for a region to deny to turn off AST use in that region.
- Customizable language config file.
- Assign commands to armor stands that are run when a player right clicks that armor stand (see below).

Assigning Commands
------------------
- Use /ascmd to assign a command to an armor stand (see usage and permissions below)
- When using /ascmd assign player <command>, the command will be run by the player
- When using /ascmd assign console <command>, the command will be run by the console (see Warning below!)
- When a player with the astools.ascmd.execute permission right-clicks on an armor stand, it's command is run.
- If a player is crouching when they right-click the armor stand, the command will not be run.
- Warning: Make sure you are careful when assigning console commands. Any player with the astools.ascmd.execute permission will be able to execute the command.
- By default, any command assigned to an armor stand will use the default cooldown set in config.yml. This can be set on an individual basis using the /ascmd cooldown <ticks> command.

Commands
--------
- /ascmd assign console <command> : Assign a console command to the nearest armor stand (within 4 blocks)
- /ascmd assign player <command> : Assign a player command to the nearest armor stand
- /ascmd remove : Remove the command assigned to the nearest armor stand
- /ascmd view : View the command assigned to the nearest armor stand
- /ascmd cooldown <ticks> : Sets the cooldown (in ticks) for the command on nearest armor stand (Setting this overrides the default cooldown from config.yml)
- /ascmd cooldown remove : Removes the cooldown for the command on nearest armor stand (Default cooldown set in config.yml will be used)
- /astools or /ast : Legacy command - instructs player to crouch right-click an armor stand to use AST.
- /astools new : Create a new armor stand - will spawn being carried by the player
- /astools reload : Reload the plugin (use when changing config files)

WorldGuard Integration
----------------------
 - If a player does not have build permission for the region, that player will also be denied the use of AST in that region.
 - Additionally, there is a custom region flag named 'ast' which defaults to Allow, this can be changed to Deny if you wish to have a  region in which players have build permission, but not permission to use AST.
 - The ast worldguard flag is ignored for any player with the permission node 'astools.bypass-wg-flag'. This means that a player with  this permission can use AST in worldguard regions even if the ast flag for that region is set to Deny.
 - The ast worldguard flag is also ignored for players that have op.

Config
------
- config.yml - The main config file allows you to set the default starting settings for newly summoned armor stands. This is useful if you plan on creating a lot of armor stands with similar equipment.
- language.yml - Contains all the strings of text that the player will see. Edit this file if you wish to change the text or translate it into a different language.
