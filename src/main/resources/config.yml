#
# Assigning Commands to Armor Stands:
#   - Stand close to the armor stand (The nearest armor stand within 4 blocks is selected) and use the command:
#     /ascmd add <priority> <delay> <player/console/bungee> <command/bungee_server_name>
#   - <priority>: When multiple commands are assigned, commands with the lowest priority number are executed first.
#                   Command with the same priority can be executed in any order.
#   - <delay>: Delay in ticks before the command is executed.
#   - <player\console\bungee>: Player commands are executed as if they were typed by the player.
#                              Console commands are executed by the console.
#                              Bungee commands are a special case (see below).
#   - <command/bungee_server_name>: The command to be executed. To use the executing player's name in the command, use the
#                                   placeholder %player% - it will be replaced with the players name at time of execution.
#   - When a player with the astools.ascmd.execute permission right-clicks on an armor stand, commands assigned to that
#     armor stand are executed.
#   - Warning: Make sure you are careful when assigning console commands. Any player with the astools.ascmd.execute
#              permission will be able to execute the command.
#   - By default, any command assigned to an armor stand will use the default cooldown set in config.yml. This can be
#     set on an individual basis using the /ascmd cooldown <ticks> command.
#   - Bungee commands: These are used to send the player to a different BungeeCord server. E.g. This will add a command
#                      to send the player to a server called server1: /ascmd add 0 0 bungee server1
#
# WorldGuard Integration:
#   - If a player does not have build permission for the region, that player will also be denied the use of AST in that region.
#   - Additionally, there is a custom region flag named 'ast' which defaults to Allow, this can be changed to Deny if you wish
#     to have a region in which players have build permission, but not permission to use AST.
#   - The ast worldguard flag is ignored for any player with the permission node 'astools.bypass-wg-flag'. This means that a
#     player with this permission can use AST in worldguard regions even if the ast flag for that region is set to Deny.
#   - The ast worldguard flag is also ignored for players that have op.
