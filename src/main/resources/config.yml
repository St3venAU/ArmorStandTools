#
# WorldGuard Integration:
#   - If a player does not have build permission for the region, that player will also be denied the use of AST in that region.
#   - Additionally, there is a custom region flag named 'ast' which defaults to Allow, this can be changed to Deny if you wish to have a
#     region in which players have build permission, but not permission to use AST.
#   - The ast worldguard flag is ignored for any player with the permission node 'astools.bypass-wg-flag'. This means that a player with
#     this permission can use AST in worldguard regions even if the ast flag for that region is set to Deny.
#   - The ast worldguard flag is also ignored for players that have op.
#
# These are the defaults for spawning new armor stands with the /astools (or /ast) armor stand
# The helmet, chest, pants, boots and inHand items are set like this: MATERIAL dataValue
# e.g. To have red wool in the armor stands hand by default: inHand: WOOL 14
